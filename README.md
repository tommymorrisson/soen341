### Objective: 
Develop an e-commerce website using agile methodologies.
### Description:
An e-commerce website allows users to buy and sell goods and services over the internet rather than in person.
Using this website, a merchant can process orders, accept payments and manage shipping to customers.
### Core features:
There are two types of users for this website:
   - Customer
   - Seller
   
These users will be able to choose which kind they are when signing up for the website.
A seller is able to:
- Add items for sale
- Add product description
- Set the product price
- Have different categories for products
- Upload pictures for the items

A buyer is able to:
- Browse the items offered by sellers
- Add a specific number of items to the cart
- Remove items from the cart
- See the prices and other fees
- Place an order
- Pay for the order
- Cancel an order
